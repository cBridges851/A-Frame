# A-Frame Repo
This repo contains the files that I created when I was learning A-Frame on Codecademy. This repo has also been created to help me learn how to use Git!

## Shapes Folder
This folder is for the first section of the Codecademy course. Here, I learnt about the primitive types, like `<a-box>`, `<a-sphere>`, `<a-cylinder>`, `<a-plane>` and `<a-sky>`, which are basic shapes (or meshes) that can be inserted.
You can have parent and child entities. For example, you could create a box which has a circle inside it.

### Components
There are few components the types can contain:
**Position** - this must be included to allow the shape to be shown on the screen. Formatted x y z. Unit is metres.|
**Color** - can be as word, Hex or RGB|
**Width**|
**Length**|
**Height**|
**Radius**|
**Rotation** - the way the shape is rotated - x y z rotation in degrees.|
**Scale** - defines shrinking, stretching or skewing transformation of an entity - 3 scaling factors for x y. Bear in mind that the value you need to change may be affected if you rotated first. If inputting a negative value, this is reflection |

## Building Scenes Folder
This will be added to as there's not much in it at the moment. It's basically about creating the VR environment, such as by adding textures to shapes and audio.

### OutOfBoxEnvironments.html
Shows an example environment that's already been created (hence why it is 'out of box')

### llynclys.html
This is just me messing with the background. Uses an image of the railway I used to go to (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/LlynclysSouth01.jpg). While it's a lovely image, it's not the best for continuity!

## Christmas 2020
This is the Christmas scene that I have created for 2020, as shown below:

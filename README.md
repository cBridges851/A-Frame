# A-Frame Repo
This repo contains the files that I created when I was learning A-Frame on Codecademy. This repo has also been created to help me learn how to use Git!

## Shapes Folder
This folder is for the first section of the Codecademy course. Here, I learnt about the primitive types, like `<a-box>`, `<a-sphere>`, `<a-cylinder>`, `<a-plane>` and `<a-sky>`, which are basic shapes (or meshes) that can be inserted.

### Components
There are few components the types can contain:
**Position** - this must be included to allow the shape to be shown on the screen. Formatted x y z. Unit is metres.|
**Color** - can be as word, Hex or RGB|
**Width**|
**Length**|
**Height**|
**Radius**|
**Rotation** - the way the shape is rotated - x y z rotation in degrees.|
**Scale** - defines shrinking, stretching or skewing transformation of an entity - 3 scaling factors for x y |
